# Lego Sensors

The Lego EV3 Mindstorms kit has many types of sensors:

## Colour Sensor

**NOTE:** The colour sensor tried to identify the colour what is reflecting the light, but is calibrated based on the *colours* used for Lego pieces. This means that certain colours might not be correctly identified.

### Example - Colour Speak

This example reads the information coming form the colour sensor and then used the speaker to say which colour is being detected.
