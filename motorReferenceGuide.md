## Motor Programming blocks

The Lego Mindstorms programming application provides 3 programming blocks for using the large motors.

**Large Motor** - This block is used to turn a large motor.

**Move Tank** - This block is used when you would like to use both motors at the same time. The block allows you to individually adjust the speeds of each motor.

All of the programming blocks for motors allow you to work in seconds, degrees or rotations. **NOTE:** Today we will be using degrees.
