Lego Mindstorms EV3 Workbooks for Grade 8 students

### Workbook 1

This workbook covers connecting the EV3 brick to a laptop of tablet, before continuing with a basic introduction to programming.

Students explore using the sound block to create tones, and then go on to sound out [Morse Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) messages using their robots.

### Workbook 2

This workbook follows on from the first, allowing students to customise their robots.

Along with the sound block for a start-up tune, students design a picture that will be displayed on the *face* of the robot on start-up. The keypad LED lights are then used to indicate when the robot is talking or trying to attract attention.

### Workbook 3

This workbook introduces the ports on the EV3 brick, before introducing motors.

The large motor is investigated, with students exploring the the various motor programming blocks, and how they affect the movement of the robot.

### Workbook 4

This workbook introduces loops, allowing students to perform more complicated movements using their robots.

Tasks are presented that require students to program their robots to follow more complicated shapes (triangles, hexagons, starts). Nested loops are introduced and some of their uses covered.
