## Section A -  EV3 start-up

Open the EV3 Mindstorms application

The EV3 application icon looks like this:

We would like to open a “New Program”, so that we can start working with our robot.

1. In the “Lobby” (default screen), on the left, select “New Project”
2. Then select “New Program” and open.

This is the programming window, this is where we will be doing all of our programming.

## Section B - Getting connected

Start off by turning on your EV3 Brick

Press the center button on your Brick to turn it on. It will take a while, but the RED light will turn GREEN when your brick is ready to use.

When you would like to turn the brick off (later), press the Back button
and then the tick [Yes]. Always make sure you brick is turned off before you put it away.

Let’s name your Brick.

1. Go to the settings menu
2. Go down to “Name Brick”
3. Your robotics kit should have a name/number on it name it that.

`What is your bricks new name?`

Once you have your brick named, connect it to your PC or tablet.

### Connecting using USB

1. If you have not done so already, open the EV3 application and open a new program.
2. Plug the USB cable into your computer, and then into the brick
3. If you get a message asking whether you would like to upgrade the firmware, click the “No” button.
4. In the bottom right of your screen, you can now be able to go see if your brick is connected.

### Connecting using Bluetooth

1. If you have not done so already, open the EV3 application and open a new program
2. On your brick, go to the settings menu, and go down
3. Open your Bluetooth settings, and make sure that both “Visibility” and “Bluetooth” are turned on.
NOTE: If you are using an iPad, you will need to select the “iPhone/iPad/iPod” setting. For Android or Windows devices, leave this setting turned off.
4. Once Bluetooth (on your brick) is turned on, open the Bluetooth settings menu for your device.
5. Select and pair with your brick.
6. A message should appear on your brick asking if you would like to pair with the device. Click the tick [Yes] option.
7. It should ask you to enter a code (by default this is 1234). Leave this as the code and pair.
8. If asked, enter this code into your device.
9. In the bottom right of your screen, you can now be able to go see if your brick is connected.

`What device are you using? (Android tablet, Apple tablet, PC, etc.)`

`How did you connect to your device?`

## Section C – Personalise your robot

Start by making a picture that shows what your robot is saying.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brent-shaw/ev3-01-beginner/master/resources/software_images/paintMessage.PNG)

In the Lego Mindstorms application, go to Tools>Image Editor and open the image that you have made. The image editor will help you get you image ready to show on the EV3 brick.

You can then use the display programming block to choose which image you would like to show.

Just like the sounds, you can create chains of these to let your robot speak.

Next you can use the lights on the EV3 bricks keypad, to let the world know that there is a picture on the screen to look at.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brent-shaw/ev3-01-beginner/master/resources/software_images/blockKeypad.png)

You can use this to change the colour of the light, make it pulse (flash), or turn the light off.

## Lesson challenge

Using the sound, display and keypad lights, make a “start-up” greeting for your robot. You can use the Morse Code from the previous lesson to say “Hello”, or you can sing a song (but remember to turn the volume down).

Use the light to flash, change colour, or show when the picture on the screen has changed. You can also add more pictures to the display if your robot has more to say.

`What is your robot's startup greeting?`

`How did you do this?`
