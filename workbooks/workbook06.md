Open the EV3 Mindstorms application

The EV3 application icon looks like this:

We would like to open a “New Program”, so that we can start working with our robot.

1. In the “Lobby” (default screen), on the left, select “New Project”
2. Then select “New Program” and open.

This is the programming window, this is where we will be doing all of our programming.

## Section B - Avoiding objects

It would be nice to let your robot roam free, but there is a good chance it will drive into things.

Since our robots don't have eyes, we will be using Lego's ultrasonic sensor. If your robot does not have the ultrasonic sensor already attached, do that now before continuing.

### Ultrasonic Sensor

This example allows the robot to freely drive about. When the robot is less that 100mm from an object, it will turn away, avoiding the object.
