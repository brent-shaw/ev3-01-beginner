# Workbook 1

## Section A -  EV3 startup

Open the EV3 Mindstorns application

The EV3 application icon looks like this:

We would like to open a “New Program”, so that we can start working with our robot.

1. In the “Lobby” (default screen), on the left, select “New Project”
2. Then select “New Program” and open.

This is the programming window, this is where we will be doing all of our programming.

## Section B - Getting connected

Start off by turning on your EV3 Brick

Press the center button on your Brick to turn it on. It will take a while, but the RED light will turn GREEN when your brick is ready to use.

When you would like to turn the brick off (later), press the Back button
and then the tick [Yes]. Always make sure you brick is turned off before you put it away.

Let’s name your Brick.

1. Go to the settings menu
2. Go down to “Name Brick”
3. Your robotics kit should have a name/number on it name it that.

`What is your bricks new name?`

Once you have your brick named, connect it to your PC or tablet.

### Connecting using USB

1. If you have not done so already, open the EV3 application and open a new program.
2. Plug the USB cable into your computer, and then into the brick
3. If you get a message asking whether you would like to upgrade the firmware, click the “No” button.
4. In the bottom right of your screen, you can now be able to go see if your brick is connected.

### Connecting using Bluetooth

1. If you have not done so already, open the EV3 application and open a new program
2. On your brick, go to the settings menu, and go down
3. Open your Bluetooth settings, and make sure that both “Visibility” and “Bluetooth” are turned on.
NOTE: If you are using an iPad, you will need to select the “iPhone/iPad/iPod” setting. For Android or Windows devices, leave this setting turned off.
4. Once Bluetooth (on your brick) is turded on, open the Bluetooth settings menu for your device.
5. Select and pair with your brick.
6. A message should appear on your brick asking if you would like to pair with the device. Click the tick [Yes] option.
7. It should ask you to enter a code (by default this is 1234). Leave this as the code and pair.
8. If asked, enter this code into your device.
9. In the bottom right of your screen, you can now be able to go see if your brick is connected.

`What device are you using? (Android tablet, Apple tablet, PC, etc.)`

`How did you connect to your device?`

## Section C – Our first program

In your EV3 Programming Windows, let’s make our robots speak.

Robots don’t really speak, they beep!

1. Make sure your brick is connected to your device.
2. Select the Sound block from the Programming Palette
3. Add the Sound block to your Programming canvas, placing it after the Start block

Before we can get started, we need to change some settings.

1. Make sure that you Sound block is set to “Play Tone”
2. Set the frequency to 1000
3. Set the duration to 0.1
4. Set the volume to 10 (100 is quite loud)

Now we can play our sounds. Click the Play icon on the Start block, or use the “Download and Run Program” button.

`What happened when you pressed the “Play” button?`

Try changing the “Frequency” and “Duration”.

`What happens when you change the frequency?`

`What happens when you change the duration?`

### Lesson challenge

The international distress signal is called an SOS. This is used by anyone that is in trouble and needs help. An SOS is normally send by creating a series of beeps:
3 short beeps (which is an ‘S’ in Morse Code)
3 longer beeps (for an ‘O’ in Morse Code)
3 short beeps (for the last ‘S’ in Morse Code)

Try program a distress signal for your robot so that it can send an “SOS” message.

`Explain how you did this:`

### ROADBLOCK
#### This is only if you made it through all the other tasks before the end of the lesson.

`Can you write other messages?`

`What was your message?`

`Write the Morse code for your message:`
